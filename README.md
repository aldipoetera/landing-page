# "Lithaus" Landing Page

This is a landing page project exercise for Odin Project. I made a fictional organization called Lithaus for people who want to know everything about lightkeepers (they called it Litkeepers); it's a history, culture and object preservation movement for demonstrational purposes.

Most of the things wasn't teached yet at Odin Project, however most of them are from the help of googling and AI (I only used them as my second CSS/HTML documentations) for the neat CSS/HTML tricks. Of course they'll fall apart if you move the tags/idea to different sections.

I learned a lot from this!
